## 1.2 High-Level Components (abstractions)

### Active Record
Is a layer in the rails application that allows the creation, retention and use of objects inside a database. 

All users data, listings data is stored into an Postgresql database. The information is stored into the database via forms inside the rails application. It can also be retrieved using simple queries inside the application, such as `Listings.all` that can be used to display data into the view.

### Active Storage
Is the layer of the rails application that's in charge of facilitates the ability for the application to upload files into a cloud storage from the application and can be queried into the application so a user can interact with.

In AccioCurios, Active Storage allows a user to upload a screenshot or picture of the product they wish to sell. This is linked to AWS S3 cloud storage, where it can be retrieved and viewed in the listings pages.

### Devise
Devise is a gem that provides the creation and maintenance of user accounts on the rails application. It interacts with Active Records to store information into the database when a user signs up. It generates the view pages and controllers required for a user to create their accounts and modify when required. Devise is required in the application to give the ability for users to create, modify or delete their own listings, safely purchase listings and show their purchases and listings on their dashboard.

### Cancancan
Cancancan is a library that provides authorisation and sets permissions in the application. It achieves this by setting defined methods in its own model which can be called to other components of the application. These methods check against the User's role, which would be defined in the database against the user's table and grants permission based on that role. It prevents other users from being able to modify or delete other user's listings.

Permissions are set inside the models/ability.rb, which is generated by Cancancan. There are three levels of permissions set inside this model.

First level is when a user is not signed up or signed in. They're able to read and view the current listings made by other users, but they must be signed in to access additional functionality.

Next level of permission is when a user is signed in. They're able to create, modify or delete their own listings, or buy other user's listings. However, they're unable to modify, or delete other user's listings.

Highest level of permission is an admin role. They're able to modify or delete users, all listings, and data in tables including categories and conditions.

### Ransack
Ransack is a rails library that allows the application to have search features. It does this by querying the database using parameters relevant the listing. In regards to this application, it looks up the title of listing and uses a 'where' clause query on the database with the input from the user.

Ransack is used because it provides the ability for a user to search the title of a listing and return the results to make it easier for users to look for specific listings in the database if they're looking for something specific.

## 1.3 Third Party Services

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap was used for css styling in the application. This allowed the implementation of styling to the website. The elements are provided from an external CDN provided by [Stack Path]("https://www.stackpath.com/"). The styles are taken from a code extract on [Bootstrap]("https://getbootstrap.com/") and modified to fit the pages styling requirement.

### Stripe
Stripe is a payment platform that allows users to purchase other user's listings. It links the user to an external page using the stripe API, where the user can enter their credit card details to complete the purchase. It's designed to allow safe transaction between buyer and seller with maximum security when processing a buyer's payment.

For stripe to pick up the correct data, it queries the database based on the listing information provided in the show page. These parameters are taken into consideration in a method that stripe utilises to return the correct details of the listing to the payment page.

The reason for using Stripe over a custom payment implementation into the application is due to PCI compliance. In order for application to process payments, it needs to meet a set of requirement set out by PCI security standards. To overcome this issue, the implementation of Stripe, an external payment platform that is already PCI compliance, and eliminates the necessary work to become PCI compliant if we decided to implement a custom payment processing system.

## 3.1 Identify the problem you’re trying to solve
AccioCurios seeks to solve the problem of having a dedicated marketplace for people to buy or sell various collectibles.

In today's market, there are plenty of big market places where people can buy, trade or sell collectibles, such as Ebay, Amazon, or Gumtree. However, these are large marketplaces that contain not only collectibles, but new items, or different type of products that aren't necessarily collectibles.

A collector may only be seeking specific collectibles and may find too many products that may or not be related to what they're looking for. AccioCurios solves this issue by providing the collectors a dedicated marketplace where they can sell and buy their collections.

It focuses on quality or rarity of the product over quantity. As it only allows a user buy a particular product from its marketplace. AccioCurios target audience would be individuals rather than businesses seeking to sell their products. Additionally, it offers a dashboard for users to check their listings and purchases they've made, making it cleaner and easier to keep track of their items.

## 3.3 Model Relationships

Condition has many listings

Category has many listings

Users has many listings

Comments belong to Listings

Listing has many comments

Purchase_history belongs to listings and users

Listings has many purchase_history

Users has many purchase_history

## 4.2 ERD Design and interaction

The interaction in the ERD is based on a simple design where the relationships revolve around the listings table. In regards to the ERD, the interaction occurs around the Listings table, which is the application's foundation is built around.

Both Conditions and Categories table in the ERD were separated from Listings for two purposes. First, it was done to normalise the data in the database and secondly it provides an opportunity to implement a filter option in application, where listings with specific conditions or categories can be retrieved. Both tables contain one field and a primary key, and their only relationship is to the listings table.

Within the Listings table, contains attributes relevant for a complete listing. The listings table contains three foreign keys. Conditions and Categories are separated from Listings to normalise the data. The listing table will store the Condition and Category ids and will reference them when the listing is created. The third foreign key ensures that the listing belong to the user that created it. The comments table has two foreign keys and a text body. The Listing table also has relationships to comments and purchase histories tables.

The comments table has two foreign keys and a text body. Firstly, it contains a foreign key to the listings table. This ensures it only relates to a specific listing rather than just any listing. The second foreign key is the user_id. The purpose of having the reference to the user table is to assign the comment made on that specific listing to a particular user in the database. This means that a listing can have multiple comments and assigns different comments under that listing to different users, which allows the ability for users to have discussions or send queries in relation to the listing.

The purchase histories table is a type of join table that is used to display when a user has purchase the product. The Purchase Histories table has two foreign keys. First, its assigned to a particular listing, and assigns the an id to the `buyer_id` with an id from the user's table. The purpose of this table is to record the information relating to the purchase of a particular listing to a particular user in the user table.

Finally, the last table is the user table, which contains information relating to user accounts within the database. User table has relations with three separate tables within the database. Firstly, a user will be able to have one or many listings. Next, the user should be able to make multiple comments to different listings. And finally, the user can have more than one purchase history, as they should be able to see all the purchases they've made.

## 6.1 User Stories

Since AccioCurios is a marketplace, the needs to be addressed for the marketplace to function effectively and efficient comes down to how functions that need to accessed and the level of privileges allowed for the different types of users. The most important need, is the ability for a user to create, read, update or destroy listings and make purchases from other users.  

There are three different levels of users that will be using the application. Each level has a specific permission and depending on the level, can prevent or allow access to certain functionality in the application. 

A guest is a user who hasn't created an account or has logged in. The scope of their interaction with the application is that they're only able to view search listings, and view the individual listings. This level of access limits the functionality of the application and encourages the guest to sign up for an account to access the more important functionalities in the application. 

When user logs in or creates an account, it provides more functionality to the user's interaction. A user at this point can, create, modify or delete their own listings, purchase other user's listings and access their own dashboards, where their listings and purchases are displayed. They're also able to delete, or modify their account details. These privileges covers most of the functionality of the application, which meets the needs of the application. 

The last level of user is an admin. The admin has the ability to view all pages, has access to the admin dashboard. They're able to delete or modify all users, all listings, conditions and categories. The purpose of giving admin access to all these abilities is that as an admin, they should have oversight of all aspects of the application. However, an admin may not be able to purchase any listings, as an admin has the ability to modify another user's listings. This ensures that the admin can't abuse their power as an admin. An example of this is an admin may reduce another user's listing price to $1.00 and purchase the item. Removing the admin's ability to purchase an item prevents this from happening.

## 6.3 Planning
Trello was used as the planning tool to document and check progress of the application. The process for keeping track of the tasks was putting them into individual cards on trello. Cards are lined up in the backlog based on the importance of the task. They are moved to 'Doing' when they're being worked on and finally moved to 'Done'. once the task is completed.
